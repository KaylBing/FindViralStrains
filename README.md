# FindViralStrains
A pipeline to sift out viral strains from data sets using MFD. 
These are early drafts and ideas for our workflow, and are not yet polished, or in some cases ever working. 
If you do have questions about anything that is happening in this workflow feel free to email me at

Cheers,
